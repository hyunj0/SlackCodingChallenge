# Slack Coding Challenge

A coding challenge for Slack prospects!

Create an app that displays a list of all users on a Slack team
using the results of a call to <a href="https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list">users.list</a>. 
Upon clicking on a user row, the app should drill into the user's profile. 
On the individual profile page, you should show the person's picture, username, real name, and title. 
Other profile fields are optional.

####Libraries used in project<br>
#####Retrofit
a great library to use when dealing with APIs
#####Gson
convert JSON to GSON and vice versa, simplifying data persistence so no SQLite database is needed
#####Picasso
cache images for offline use

You are given a week to complete the assignment though a good afternoon's worth of work should suffice.
Hence, I challenged myself to under a day and succeeded!!
